# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results-
For this project, We are working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. Our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:      Implement the new webpage,     Keep the old webpage, or     Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
